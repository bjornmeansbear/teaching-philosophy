# A Teaching Philosophy

> Design is only design if it communicates knowledge. -- Enzo Mari

> Teaching is more difficult than learning because what teaching calls for is this: to let learn. The real teacher, in fact, lets nothing else be learned than learning. His conduct, therefore, often produces the impression that we learn nothing from him, if by "learning" we now suddenly understand the procurement of useful information. -- Martin Heidegar

> Teach what you most want to learn -- Sim Van Der Ryn

> What is essential is invisible to the eye -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

> Did you ever grow anything in the garden of your mind -- Fred Rogers

> On the whole there is nothing wrong and nothing right, it simply lives and materializes through the interplay of the forces... — Paul Klee, 1921

> “If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don't bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.” — R. Buckminster Fuller

> If someone notices something wrong, they are almost always right that something is wrong — but their way of fixing it probably isn't. So listen to the problem — but you have to find the solution for your own work yourself. -- Lisa Brennan-Jobs in ep007 of On Margins speaking with Craig Mod (≈09:12)

> A designer is an emerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist and evolutionary strategist. — R. Buckminster Fuller

While we like to talk about design in grandiose terms, design students are often still taught to simply be service providers — classes are filled with learning software and creating portfolio-ready work that will get them a job when they graduate -- Jarrett Fuller

What is design? making your ideology realized in an object. It tries to be understandable. Design tries to signal a specific something; an intentional specific meaning that is hoped to be controlled for the right audience and context.

## Design Recipes
david rudnick: In thinking more about your fine dining analogy, one thing that the chefs have to disseminate their work is technique and recipe sharing. A chef will document what tools, ingredients, techniques, etc. are required to make a dish, and then everyone else can try to do that; do designers have an equivalent? should we be writing design "cook books" to help inspire other designers and the general populace?

## Free as in Freedom
If academia is supposed to create new knowledge, we need to get better about abandoning proprietary tools and framworks and adopt and create more free (and in open) ones!

## Design without Adobe
Why limit our tools of creation to just those that Adobe chooses to let us have access too? If the situation in venezuela is any indication, capitalist entities have no interest in serving customers access to creativity perpetually...

Design requires artistic skill, technical prowess, and conceptual thinking. Design is a communication mediator, a research tool, and a collaborator in the creation of culture. My desires are to encourage students to explore these facets of design, and to investigate future possibilities for the discipline. The first day of class in every course begins with the statement that design can be used for intellectual inquiry and self-expression, not just executing a client’s wishes.

Education is an active experience. Teachers and students are equal participants. I will help students find their formal and intellectual capabilities; but students must take responsibility for their personal growth. Given the constraints of an assignment, I ask students to respond as they see fit to provided prompts and exercises. Students are asked to use whatever interests they have in fleshing out their solutions. Students are provided with room to make up their own minds about what constitutes good, well-formed, successful design (provided they can explain their choices in sensical fashion). I help and guide how I am able.

My students will become self-reliant thinkers and doers. I want my students at the forefront of the discussion around design’s future. I want my students providing aesthetic solutions for what tomorrow’s design looks like. I want my students to have practical, applicable knowledge and speculative, fantastical projects under their belts. I want my students to succeed in my classroom and to continue succeeding when they have left academia’s walls and entered “the world.”

My attempts to achieve the above include:
- maintaining an open dialogue, critiques, and discussion;
- encouraging students to bring personal interests to assigned prompts;
- delivering my point of view as a teacher, experimenter, and practicing designer;
- finding alternative points of view to my own to include in lectures, discussions, etc;
- promoting individual judgments of taste and quality (students should find their own point of view, not just regurgitate mine or other peers’, teachers’, colleagues’, or the internet’s);
- asking students to remain skeptical (but not to be cynical — constantly questioning existing solutions so we may explore and offer alternatives to how things are);
- and, embracing the speculative so as to create more room for discussion.
The following are a series of aphorisms to further explain my design teaching thoughts.

## A Good Teacher
A good teacher need not have complete knowledge of the courses they teach (or even any -- one can learn along with the students). But! A good teacher does understand where to look for (or who to ask for) up-to-date information about their course’s subjects (as well as subjects related to course contents — this can be difficult, see _you can’t know everything_). A good teacher provides historical context for material in a course. A good teacher provides contemporary context for material in a course. A good teacher facilitates discussion and understanding between students (and sometimes facilitates intellectual conflict). A good teacher must promote conceptual reasoning (abstraction and reflection used to solve a design problem) and help students become analytical thinkers (good at separating a complex design problem into its constituent smaller parts).

## You can’t know everything.
Circumstances for making are constantly changing — equipment, knowledge, materials, and other constraints are different from scenario-to-scenario and from year-to-year (or lately, on places like the web, week-to-week or even day-to-day). A good teacher acknowledges they won’t be able to answer every question, keep up with every new direction, understand every tool, or know every available solution. This is fine. A good teacher is transparent when ignorant, and offers avenues for exploration or further help from elsewhere (perhaps another colleague, the right book from the library, a lead from social or art history, or a well-crafted google search). Being a professional isn’t about knowing everything, it’s about remembering how to find and ask for help.

## Technology & Tools.
Computers and software are just tools. Contemporary technological tools are no different than an x-acto knife: no one tool is usable for everything; and, tools take practice and thoughtfulness to be used well. We have reached a quantity and complexity of available tools where no single person can master all instruments. Designers should pick tools that offer the most future possibilities, not just the best short term outcomes. This is an important part of teaching in the “new media” sphere: not mastering all options, but sussing out what is important long term. A good teacher focuses on design concepts that are applicable to a wide range of tools and processes, not just to what the newest technological trend is. Learning technology (learning tools generally) should be seen as a way to illustrate and enhance design fundamentals, not just a merit badge to be earned.

## Learning vs. Understanding.
Because a student has learned a technical skill does not mean they comprehend the best time, place, or use for said skill. Classrooms are where understanding happens — you can put technical skills to work outside of a simple demonstration or project. Class time should create connections between demonstrated tools, and skills and other larger ideas and concerns (social, cultural, economic, etc.). These connections result in increased comprehension for how one might use design to investigate any presented problem.

## On Practicing
A good teacher helps students realize that simply having access to tools does not result in expertise. Understanding a tool takes patience, time, and practice. We must practice using software, seeing accurate form, and crafting ideas just like we had to practice drawing, bicycling, or piano playing. This takes time. The process is frustrating. A good teacher integrates practice as part of applying a tool to a larger idea, not just practicing the tool itself (facilitating understanding over mere learning). Students should be encouraged to spend time outside of class practicing their making and practicing their thinking with new and different tools. Explorations following that encouragement may lead to less-than aesthetically wonderful results. This is not failure. Not everything need end with perfect, precise materials.

## Precision in design.
Precision in contemporary design is not about who can make the most meticulously perfect artifact, but about who can master enough myriad skills and techniques that their vision and talent is applicable to any medium — we shall embrace trans-media comfort. (Formal perfection is still a valiant aim, but it is no longer the only goal.)

## Quality
A good teacher (and a good designer) must believe that one thing is better than another. However, a good teacher doesn’t assume that design results in only one sort of “nice” thing. When using design as a critical tool, there must be room for the “ugly” and the “negative” in addition to the “beautiful” and the “uplifting.” Ugly and negative aren’t the same as “bad” and can still be of quality. A good teacher must help each student explore and articulate “goodness” in their own eyes — in the works students make themselves and in work that students admire.

## Complexity
Life is complex. Today’s problems involve all manner of inputs, outputs, content, contexts, devices, and formats. It is impossible to know or understand all aspects of a design problem. But, while life is complex, it does not have to be confusing. A good teacher shows students how to evaluate complexity and then provide clues as to what are appropriate uses, paths, etc. with the end goal of making the designed objects around us usable and understandable. Design is a tool for making complex comprehensible. This is not the same as making things simple, it is about properly communicating intent.

## Conceptual Thinking
Different intents require different solutions. Conceptual thinking results in work where ideas based on content and context map to formal conclusions (the correct contentual «» contextual «» formal relationships are found). Being able to adeptly use and describe connections between form, content, and context is key — ideas are only useful if they result in the lucid arguments (meaning it is the correct concept and the correct form for the audience). Design solutions lacking integrity between content and context and form, or work propped up solely by baroque explanation or otherwise tenuous themes, has not been properly thought out. (See accurate vs. formal)

## Minimum Viable Product.
Software development has a methodology called “agile” whose goal is quickly solving, resolving, and iterating solutions. The first step is to come up with the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This MVP doesn’t have all the features nor polish. Its goal is to achieve the minimum requirements as rapidly as possible. The next iteration tries to refine and fix found issues, builds more feature robustness, or sometimes re-imagines or re-builds the solution a different way if the first proved to have too many bugs or conceptual holes. Design teaching (and design making) benefits from adopting this ideology. Things do not have to be “finished” to allow a student to grow. Doing, failing, and moving on can be more useful for understanding than refining towards an unrealistic formal ideal.

## Less but Better (from Dieter Rams).
Lectures, examples, demos, speakers, videos, readings, and discussions are all great — but can get in the way of what class is also about: providing structured time to practice designing. A good teacher needs to know when to step back, let the students dig into their projects, and wander around the room peering over shoulders and offering small bits of individualized advice.

## In Closing.
Successful teaching culminates with students applying teachings from the classroom to their own lives, not just assigned projects. My goal is for students to leave my classroom (and their schooling as a whole) with a better understanding of the world around them and a consideration for how design and they themselves fit into that world.

the importance of local knowledge and knowing place!?

experimenting to help learning take place.

what is a sign?

what is a substrate?

design is signs on substrates...

the ultimate aim of design must be the restoration of spaceship earth (from Gropius's Bauhaus manifesto, 1919)
